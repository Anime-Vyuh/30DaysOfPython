#Program 1: Factorial 

Find factorial of any number given
Factorial of number is calculated by multiplying n*(n-1)
Sample Input:4
Factorial: 4*3*2*1
Output: 24
Sample input:6
Factorial: 6*5*4*3*2*1
Output:720

Method 1 using For loop

f=1
n = int(input('Sample input:'))
for i in range(1,n+1):
    f=f*i
print(f)

Method 2 using while loop

f=1
n = int(input(‘Sample input:’))
while(n>0):
    f=f*n
    n=n-1
print(f)

#Program 2: Guess a Number

Ask a user to guess a number between 1 to 50. He gets only 5 chance to guess. Give user a feedback if his guess is high or low.  

import random

num=random.randint(1,50)
print("Guess a Number from 1-50 \n You have only 5 chance\n")
chances=0
while chances<5:    #you only get 5 chances to guess
    guess=int(input('Take a guess:'))
    if guess<num:
        print('Your guess is too low')
        chances+=1
    if guess>num:
        print('Your guess is too high')
        chances+=1
    if guess==num:
        chances+=1
        break
else:
    print("You ran out of chances")
if guess==num:
    print('Nicely Done! You guessed the number in ',chances,' guesses')

#Program 3: FizzBuzz

Consider ‘n’ numbers, print all the numbers from 1 to n and replace some number according to this criteria:
    • If the number is divisible by 3, write Fizz instead of the number
    • If the number is divisible by 5, write Buzz instead of the number
    • If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, write FizzBuzz instead of the number
[Constraints n should be more than 1 and less than 100; i.e., 1<=n<100]

while True:
    n = int(input("Enter a number(1-100):"))
    if n>=1 and n<=100:
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i%3 == 0 and i%5==0:
                print("FizzBuzz")
            elif i%3==0:
                print("Fizz")
            elif i%5==0:
                print("Buzz")
            else:
                print(i)
        break
    else:
        continue

#Program 4: Neon Number

Enter a number and check whether the number is neon number or not
Sample input: 9
Sample output: Yes it is a neon number
Sample input: 6
Sample output: No it is not a neon number

***[Neon number explanation: input=9
Step one: 9*9 =81 
Step two: 81 = 8+1 = 9
Step three: 9 == sample input
Yes it is a neon number]***

n = int(input("Sample input:"))
first_step=n*n
sum=0
while(first_step>0):
    second_step=first_step%10
    sum+=second_step
    first_step=first_step//10
if(sum==n):
    print('The given number',n,'is neon number')
else:
    print('The given number',n,'is not neon number')
